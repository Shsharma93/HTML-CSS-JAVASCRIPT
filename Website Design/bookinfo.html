		The story of this book is a fiction story. It is wrapped up with a story of a famous lawyer who has stopped his full day to day working hours, to become a monk. This former lawyer was a very successful lawyer in his field. He can have everything he wants in his life. However, he does not have a happy family and a happy life because of the pressure of works and of the high profile life that he had lived. Suddenly, he was collapsed because of severe illness. After medication, he has decided to stop doing litigation work and he travelled to India to find his purpose in life. He gained essential lessons of life while he has travelled in India. He then shares his knowledge to his fellow lawyer with the condition that the lawyer himself must forward this knowledge to other people. This is also my obligation to write a simple summary of this book for you all to read and digest.
